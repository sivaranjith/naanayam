only core has be completed and the remaning:
      make n-bits dynamic
      add block after any node as per user request(and then how to point to the longest chain)

application which use core is yet to start



accounts:
	creating a new account
		create a new private key and get the corresponding public key


transaction:
	creating a transaction
		verify a transaction
			check if the previous transaction is in utxo for the respective index
			executing the script sig

	getting the transaction as a writable format
	creating a transaction id


block:
	proof of work
		collecting transaction list and the forming coinbase transaction
		form the merkle tree
		find a hash that satisfies the n-bits

		transaction list should be list of transactions not list of string

make n-bits dynamic

blockchain:
	add the block to the chain and point to the longest chain
